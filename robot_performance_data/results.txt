Battery voltage was ~24.2V when these were measured (full operating range: 22.2V-25.2V)

Linear Performance Parameters:
acceleration and deceleration gains seem to infinite
(as there is almost instantaneous acceleration change)
v_max	= 2.10 	m/s
a_max 	= 0.67	m/s^2
a_min 	= -0.65 m/s^2
From the above data, we can calculate:
Max stopping time ~ 3s
Max stopping linear displacement ~ 3.3m

Angular Performance Parameters:
acceleration and deceleration gains seem to infinite
(as there is almost instantaneous acceleration change)
aplha_max 	= 2.06 	rad/s^2
alpha_min 	= -1.90 rad/s^2
omega_max 	= 6.25 	rad/s
From the above data, we can calculate:
Max stopping time ~ 3s
Max stopping angular displacement ~ 10 rad
